[TODO]

not sure yet..
thinking about a triple-license of some sort,

1) opensource
   gpl(3)

2) freeware
   maybe requirements about plugin formats, etc..
   freely available/distributable binaries,
   no registration or anything like that..

3) commercial
   the ugly one..

but i should probably talk to someone who knows more about this..
see individual source files for more info and licenses (for derived stuff).
anyway, if you use anything in here that is either gpl,
or derived from things that are gpl, you have to be gpl too.

KLL - kode.libre.license (gpl3?)
KFL - kode.free.license (mit/bsd variant)
KPL - kode.proproetary.license (individual)
