* sample-accurate automation

  currently, the automation uses the last value received per block
  todo: ramp/interpolate
  a) split block at parameter changes, interpolate parameter values
     between those
  b) give plugins the (sorted) list of parameter changes for the
     current block
  c) keep track of interpolated parameter values, add function to
     calc value for current sample in block..

----------

* data-transfer

  safe, thread-safe, lock/wait-free way to transfer data to/from processing
  and/or gui parts?

  samples for ffft analysis, to paint output uv/waveforms, image to audio,..

----------

* parameter dezipping

----------

* tick-processing

  cache lines = 16 floats
  simd = 4 floats (or 8 for avx?)
  4 simd operations per cache line
  - unrolling loops
  - const propagation
  split processing block into 16-samples chunks
  hardcode as much as posssible, even destination addressed
  (calc to hardcoded 16-samples buffer, so that all low-level processing
  functions are loop-unrolled, fixed number of iterations, etc..

  16 samples = 0.3ms at 48khz..

----------

* parameters

  - dB
  - hz

* mouse cursor

  investigate why we get these weird cursors..
  looks like kd
----------

* scrollbox

----------

* resizer

  when realigning widgets, we start from initial_rect.. when resizing, we need
  to keep track of how much this has chaned, or perhaps modify this initial
  rect directly.. but this will be lost when we close the plugin, won't it?
